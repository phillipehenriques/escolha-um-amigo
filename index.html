                    <p>The Kerry Beagle believed to date back to the 16th century; detailed pedigrees date back as far as 1794. By the 1800s the Kerry 
                        Beagle's numbers had dwindled in Ireland, with only one major pack maintained, the famous Scarteen of County Limerick belonging 
                        to the Ryan family, which still exists today.
                        Originally bred as staghounds, today they are used to hunt fox and hare and take part in drag hunting.                       
                        The Kerry Beagle was taken by many Irish immigrants to the Americas, and is considered a foundation breed in the development of 
                        the Coonhounds.                       
                        The name 'Beagle' is thought to derive from the Irish word 'beag' meaning 'small'.
                        The general appearance of the beagle resembles that of a miniature foxhound, but the head is wider and the muzzle shorter, 
                        the expression completely different and the legs shorter in proportion to the body. They are usually between 33 and 41 
                        centimeters tall at the withers and weigh between 8.2 and 16 kilograms, with females slightly smaller than males on average.</p>
